   * implemented, since the method cannot return multiple things If there is a way to send clients
   * messages from the code below, that would fix this
   * <p>
   * Currently, the method recieves the board and the player's move in the form of the index of the
   * column that player played into, and returns the updated board state. This method would
   * theoretically be able to be implemented in a place where it has access to some way to update
   * board, and send a message to either player. I am extremely sorry for leaving this mess, but
   * hopefully it is helpful to you in some way. IF THIS CODE IS NOT HELPFUL, PLEASE DELETE IT.
